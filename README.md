# Pydata Airflow Workshop Notebook

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook form the "Scheduling Machine Learning Pipelines using Apache Airflow" workshop @ PyData Eindhoven 2019. Note that the results are not fully reproducible, as the infrastructure provided during the workshop has been destroyed. This notebook should serve as reference if you would like incorporate the learnings of this workshop into your own work.
